NEVACOIN
======

Nevacoin is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a focus on high performance, longevity and adoption services.

Nevacoin is one of the first cryptocurrencies to use the Blake2s hashing algorithm. Blake2s is a high speed optimized cryptographic hashing algorithm used for proof-of-work and proof-of-stake hashes in Nevacoin for performance with low load. This makes Nevacoin ideally suited for dedicated staking devices and low-power/low-spec systems.

Originally dependent on the "libb2" library version of the Blake2s reference distribution, the blake2s reference implementation has now been directly baked in for ease of compilation across platforms.  Users no longer need to download and install libb2 separately.

If you are technical and you wish to compile libb2 specifically for your platform you may still do so (the configure script will auto-detect and enable special CPU features), you can modify your .pro or daemon makefile.* to remove the blake2 source and object file references, add -lb2 to your LIBS and paths to the includes and library (refer to the old commits).

Nevacoin will feature a number of innovative solutions devised to foster the growth of the ecosystem.
